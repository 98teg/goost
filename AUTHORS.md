# Goost authors

Goost is developed by a community of voluntary contributors who contribute code,
bug reports, documentation, artwork, support, etc.

This file aims at listing the developers who contributed significant patches to
this MIT licensed source code. "Significant" is arbitrarily decided, but should
be fair :)

GitHub usernames are indicated in parentheses, or as sole entry when no other
name is available.
